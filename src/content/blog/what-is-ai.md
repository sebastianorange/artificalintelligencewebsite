description: A quick rundown on what Artifical Intelligence is.

AI, short for Artifical Intelligence, is a technology that allows computers/CPUs to simulate human's learning, problem solving, decision making, comphrension and creativity to nearly solve
problems flawlessly. Of course, AI is not perfect as it is still a new technology that still needs more training before it can be 100% relied upon.

# THE HISTORY OF AI

AI has been a concept that's been around for a LONG time technically. Not the type of AI we know it to be now but through the word, "automation."

The groundwork of AI was inspired from 1921, when Czech playwright Karel Capek introduced robots, or as he originally called them, <b>"artifical people."</b>

However, the birth of AI came from around 1950-1956 when the AIs began to truly automate such as 
    - Alan Turning's The Imitation Game Concept
    - Arthur Samuel's Checkers AI

The explosion usage of the word, "Artificial Intelligence" came from John McCarthy when he held a workshop at Dartmouth in 1955 that he spoke of the words we use today.

# WHY DO WE HAVE AI?

We have and use AI because it helps make life more easier in some ways. Like in examples, helping out solve a homework problem. Sure, it won't be right 99% of the time but it can help give
breakdowns and ideas of what the answer is with the detailed explanation it can provide.
