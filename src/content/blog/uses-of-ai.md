Let's face it. AI is becoming more and more integrated into our everyday lives. But, what are some ways we are using it all the time?

# THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND: CHATGPT.
ChatGPT is one of the most well known AIs on this planet. To say you don't know it, you have to be living under a rock because if you're a student, worker, or tech enthusiast you have FOR SURE heard of this.

This AI is used in so many other AI softwares and in everyday use now that phones and computers are beginning to integrate into their OS, along web browsers also integrating AI into search results.
However, problems arise with ChatGPT like plagiarism and it become a necessity rather than a tool to help. 

# MAPS NAVIGATION
Maps navigation apps use AI to plot the best route for you to take to a destination, even with real-time adjustments as
events occur such as crashes, road closures, traffic, etc. These AI can also adjust to reports from people if there is an unreported crash.

Though, these Map Navigations can be flawed and it is always recommended that the person/driver using this tool to always pay attention
to the road even though the maps could have been accurate for the past 5-10 routes they've done.

# VOICE ASSISTANTS
Things like Siri, Google, and Alexa are also all forms of AI that help us in everyday life too. These are classified as <b>Voice Assistants</b> which we are able to ask almost any ethical question
we can ask.

We can use these voice assistants to give us basic necessities such as timers, checking the weather, alarm clocks, reminders, etc.
I personally use a Google Home that contains the Google Assistant to set my alarm clocks and even to play music sometimes as a speaker.

# AUTOMATED VEHICLES
We've all seen the movies where eventually we'd have flying cars, self driving vehicles, robot people, etc.
However, out of these 3, self driving vehicles is the closest and most accurate thing we almost have in this modern day and age.

Tesla is the most notorious EV vehicle manufacturer, known for their autopilot feature mostly.
The autopilot feature today (as of Decemeber 2024) is one of the most sharp autopilot driving features that you can use in a passenger vehicle.

However, these autopilot features are NOT 100% ACCURATE and can be very flawed. Tesla makes it very strictly known that the driver no matter what should ALWAYS pay attention no matter what.

<i>NOTE: TESLA IS NOT THE ONLY AUTOPILOT FEATURE HOLDING VEHICLE. OTHER COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR FEATURES AS WELL.</i>
