There's no say to what AI holds for us in the future. We are currently experiencing it at the moment, though there are some instances of
known future plans for AI and things have also been shown off too.

# FUNCTIONAL HUMAN-LIKE ROBOTS
As of recently, Tesla has been developing Robots named Optimus. There have been videos of them surfacing at a showcase bartending, having normal conversations with
actual humans and doing other human activities like being a cashier.

This gives I, Robot vibes since we saw how out of hand they got but, the chances of AIs actually become self-aware (as if they aren't already) and having some form of
vendetta to destroy the world still seems slim rather than a high chance.

# PROGRESSION OF AUTOPILOT
Autopilot in vehicles is coming a long way since it was first being developed. Tesla is a prime example of their autopilot becoming more advanced and
aware of its own surroundings, as well as being able to adjust to conflicts around it like avoiding collisions.

Though autopilot seems like it can't get any better, it only can further advance the more it's trained and eventually, autopilot will become
a daily usage in everyday life for long trips primarily.

# QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS
AI will continue to become more and more integrated into our lives as the years go. We are already seeing voice assistants becoming more advanced and
more user-friendly as they become more adjusted to the way they understand human perception.
